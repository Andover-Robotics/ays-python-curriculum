## The Sort Method

The `sort` method arranged a list in ascending order. `sort` does not have a parameter, and it does not return a new list. The `sort` method modifies the original list.

```python
my_list = [23, 55, 11, 7, 82.9, -14, 0, 34]
print(my_list)
my_list.sort()
print(my_list)
```

## What happens if you:
* Change the list to `my_list = ["zebra", "door", "apple", "cat", "deer", "bark"]`?
* Change the list to `my_list = [23, 15, "red", 90, -8, False]`?
* Change the list to `my_list = ["APPLE", "apple", Apple"]`?
