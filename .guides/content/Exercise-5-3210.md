## Recursion Exercise 5

**Problem**
Write a recursive function called `recursive_product` that takes two integers as parameters. For this problem, the multiplication of `x * y` will be defined as adding `x` to itself `y` times. 

**Expected Output**
* If the function call is `recursive_product(5, 4)`, then the function would return `20`
* If the function call is `recursive_product(20, 10)`, then the function would return `200`
