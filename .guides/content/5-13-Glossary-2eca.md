--------

floor division:
:   An operator, denoted <span>//</span>, that divides two numbers and rounds down (toward negative infinity) to an integer.

modulus operator:
:   An operator, denoted with a percent sign (<span>%</span>), that works on integers and returns the remainder when one number is divided by another.

boolean expression:
:   An expression whose value is either <span>True</span> or <span>False</span>.

relational operator:
:   One of the operators that compares its operands: <span>==</span>, <span>!=</span>, <span>\></span>, <span>\<</span>, <span>\>=</span>, and <span>\<=</span>.

logical operator:
:   One of the operators that combines boolean expressions: <span>and</span>, <span>or</span>, and <span>not</span>.

conditional statement:
:   A statement that controls the flow of execution depending on some condition.

condition:
:   The boolean expression in a conditional statement that determines which branch runs.

compound statement:
:   A statement that consists of a header and a body. The header ends with a colon (:). The body is indented relative to the header.

branch:
:   One of the alternative sequences of statements in a conditional statement.

chained conditional:
:   A conditional statement with a series of alternative branches.

nested conditional:
:   A conditional statement that appears in one of the branches of another conditional statement.

return statement:
:   A statement that causes a function to end immediately and return to the caller.

recursion:
:   The process of calling the function that is currently executing.

base case:
:   A conditional branch in a recursive function that does not make a recursive call.

infinite recursion:
:   A recursion that doesnâ€™t have a base case, or never reaches it. Eventually, an infinite recursion causes a runtime error.
