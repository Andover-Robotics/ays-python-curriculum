---------------------

An <span>**assignment statement**</span> creates a new variable and gives it a value:

    >>> message = 'And now for something completely different'
    >>> n = 17
    >>> pi = 3.141592653589793

This example makes three assignments. The first assigns a string to a new variable named <span>message</span>; the second gives the integer <span>17</span> to <span>n</span>; the third assigns the (approximate) value of $\pi$ to <span>pi</span>.

A common way to represent variables on paper is to write the name with an arrow pointing to its value. This kind of figure is called a <span>**state diagram**</span> because it shows what state each of the variables is in (think of it as the variable’s state of mind). Figure  shows the result of the previous example.
