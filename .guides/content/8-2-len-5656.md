----------------

<span>len</span> is a built-in function that returns the number of characters in a string:

    >>> fruit = 'banana'
    >>> len(fruit)
    6

To get the last letter of a string, you might be tempted to try something like this:

    >>> length = len(fruit)
    >>> last = fruit[length]
    IndexError: string index out of range

The reason for the <span>IndexError</span> is that there is no letter in <span>’banana’</span> with the index 6. Since we started counting at zero, the six letters are numbered 0 to 5. To get the last character, you have to subtract 1 from <span>length</span>:

    >>> last = fruit[length-1]
    >>> last
    'a'

Or you can use negative indices, which count backward from the end of the string. The expression <span>fruit[-1]</span> yields the last letter, <span>fruit[-2]</span> yields the second to last, and so on.
