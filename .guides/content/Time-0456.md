As another example of a programmer-defined type, we’ll define a class called <span>Time</span> that records the time of day. The class definition looks like this:

    class Time:
        """Represents the time of day.
           
        attributes: hour, minute, second
        """

We can create a new <span>Time</span> object and assign attributes for hours, minutes, and seconds:

    time = Time()
    time.hour = 11
    time.minute = 59
    time.second = 30

The state diagram for the <span>Time</span> object looks like Figure .

As an exercise, write a function called `print_time` that takes a Time object and prints it in the form <span>hour:minute:second</span>. Hint: the format sequence `'%.2d'` prints an integer using at least two digits, including a leading zero if necessary.

Write a boolean function called `is_after` that takes two Time objects, <span>t1</span> and <span>t2</span>, and returns <span>True</span> if <span>t1</span> follows <span>t2</span> chronologically and <span>False</span> otherwise. Challenge: don’t use an <span>if</span> statement.
