To keep track of which variables can be used where, it is sometimes useful to draw a <span>**stack diagram**</span>. Like state diagrams, stack diagrams show the value of each variable, but they also show the function each variable belongs to.

Each function is represented by a <span>**frame**</span>. A frame is a box with the name of a function beside it and the parameters and variables of the function inside it. The stack diagram for the previous example is shown in FigureÂ .

The frames are arranged in a stack that indicates which function called which, and so on. In this example, `print_twice` was called by `cat_twice`, and `cat_twice` was called by `__main__`, which is a special name for the topmost frame. When you create a variable outside of any function, it belongs to `__main__`.

Each parameter refers to the same value as its corresponding argument. So, <span>part1</span> has the same value as <span>line1</span>, <span>part2</span> has the same value as <span>line2</span>, and <span>bruce</span> has the same value as <span>cat</span>.

If an error occurs during a function call, Python prints the name of the function, the name of the function that called it, and the name of the function that called <span>*that*</span>, all the way back to `__main__`.

For example, if you try to access <span>cat</span> from within `print_twice`, you get a <span>NameError</span>:

    Traceback (innermost last):
      File "test.py", line 13, in __main__
        cat_twice(line1, line2)
      File "test.py", line 5, in cat_twice
        print_twice(cat)
      File "test.py", line 9, in print_twice
        print(cat)
    NameError: name 'cat' is not defined

This list of functions is called a <span>**traceback**</span>. It tells you what program file the error occurred in, and what line, and what functions were executing at the time. It also shows the line of code that caused the error.

The order of the functions in the traceback is the same as the order of the frames in the stack diagram. The function that is currently running is at the bottom.
