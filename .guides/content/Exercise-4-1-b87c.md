Use the following code file: </code/polygon.py>.

1.  Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program while executing <span>circle(bob, radius)</span>. You can do the arithmetic by hand or add <span>print</span> statements to the code.

{Try It}(sh .guides/bg.sh python3 code/polygon.py)

2.  The version of <span>arc</span> in SectionÂ 4.7 is not very accurate because the linear approximation of the circle is always outside the true circle. As a result, the Turtle ends up a few pixels away from the correct destination. My solution shows a way to reduce the effect of this error. Read the code and see if it makes sense to you. If you draw a diagram, you might see how it works.
