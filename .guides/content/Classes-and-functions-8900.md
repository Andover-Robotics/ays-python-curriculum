=============================

Now that we know how to create new types, the next step is to write functions that take programmer-defined objects as parameters and return them as results. In this chapter I also present “functional programming style” and two new program development plans.

Code examples from this chapter are available from <http://thinkpython2.com/code/Time1.py>. Solutions to the exercises are at <http://thinkpython2.com/code/Time1_soln.py>.
