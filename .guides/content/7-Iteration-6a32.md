===========

This chapter is about iteration, which is the ability to run a block of statements repeatedly. We saw a kind of iteration, using recursion, in Section 5.8. We saw another kind, using a <span>for</span> loop, in Section 4.2. In this chapter we’ll see yet another kind, using a <span>while</span> statement. But first I want to say a little more about variable assignment.
