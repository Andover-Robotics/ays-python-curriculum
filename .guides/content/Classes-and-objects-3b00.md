==========================

At this point you know how to use functions to organize code and built-in types to organize data. The next step is to learn “object-oriented programming”, which uses programmer-defined types to organize both code and data. Object-oriented programming is a big topic; it will take a few chapters to get there.

Code examples from this chapter are available from <http://thinkpython2.com/code/Point1.py>; solutions to the exercises are available from <http://thinkpython2.com/code/Point1_soln.py>.
