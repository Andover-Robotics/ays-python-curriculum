## Strings
A string is a collection of text, numbers, or symbols. Strings are always surrounded by quotation marks.

```python
string_variable = "This is a string"
second_string = 'This is a string also'
print(string_variable)
print(second_string)
```

## What happens if you:
* Mix single (`'`) and double (`"`) quotation marks?
* Forget one of the quotation marks?
* Forget both quotation marks?

Notice that when you print a string, the quotation marks are not printed.
