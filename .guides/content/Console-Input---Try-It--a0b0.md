## Experiment
Now it's your turn! Try out `input()`, with and without a provided string. 

What happens if you input numbers? Are they read as numbers or as a string? 

Use the following button to run your code from the editor. A console will appear to allow input.

{Try It | terminal}(python3 code/fundamentals/input_diy.py ; read -n 1 -s -r -p "Press any key to exit" ; exit)

## Challenge
Can you make a program that asks for the user's first and last names separately, then prints them out in the following format: `Last, First`?

Once again, use the following button to run your code from the editor. A console will appear to enable input.

{Try It | terminal}(python3 code/fundamentals/input_diy.py ; read -n 1 -s -r -p "Press any key to exit" ; exit)

<details><summary>Need a hint?</summary>Read the values using two `input()`s and store the results in variables. Then use string concatenation to format an output: `last + ', ' + first`</details>
