## Lists Exercise 3

**Problem**
Write a program that takes a list called `strings` that contains a random selection of strings. Your program should print the first string when arranged in alphabetical order. **Note** use single quotes with your list of strings, the auto-grader will not work with double quotes.

**Expected Output**
* If `strings = ['luck', 'cat', 'kid', 'house']` then you will print `cat`
* If `strings = ['duck', 'dddd', 'mouse', 'kite']` then you will print `dddd`

**Important**
Do not submit your code to be graded with the variable `strings`. The auto-grader will declare the variable for you.
