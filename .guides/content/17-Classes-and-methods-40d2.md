============================

Although we are using some of Python’s object-oriented features, the programs from the last two chapters are not really object-oriented because they don’t represent the relationships between programmer-defined types and the functions that operate on them. The next step is to transform those functions into methods that make the relationships explicit.

Code examples from this chapter are available from <http://thinkpython2.com/code/Time2.py>, and solutions to the exercises are in <http://thinkpython2.com/code/Point2_soln.py>.
