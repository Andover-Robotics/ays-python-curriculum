Write a function that reads the words in <span>words.txt</span> and stores them as keys in a dictionary. It doesn’t matter what the values are. Then you can use the <span>in</span> operator as a fast way to check whether a string is in the dictionary.

If you did Exercise 10.10, you can compare the speed of this implementation with the list <span>in</span> operator and the bisection search.
