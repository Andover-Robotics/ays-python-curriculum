## Files Exercise 1

**Problem**
Write a program that reads a comma delimited CSV file with four columns and returns the average of each column in the file.

**Expected Output**
The first three lines of your code **must** look like this:

```python
import os, sys

path = sys.argv[1]
file_name = sys.argv[2]
```
This allows for different text files and paths to be sent to your program for testing. The `TRY IT` button below will send a test file to your program. You should see the following output:

```text
10.0 8.0 6.0 20.0
```
