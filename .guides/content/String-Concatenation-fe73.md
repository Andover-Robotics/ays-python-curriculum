## String Concatenation
String concatenation is the act of combining two strings together. This is done with the `+` operator.

```python
a = "This is an "
b = "example string"
c = a + b
print(c)
```

Strings can also use the `+=` operator for concatenation.

```python
a = "This is an "
b = "example string"
a += b
print(a)
```

## What happens if you:
* Concatenate two strings without an extra space (e.g. `a = "This is an"`)?
* Add `3` to a string?
* Add `"3"` to a string?
