## Assumptions
Students are familiar with string basics like concatenation and type casting. Students should also be able to reference items with indexes.

## Limitations
String formatting with `%` will be mentioned briefly, and students will be advised to write their code with modern Python. The section on f-strings require at least Python 3.6. If you are going to include this lesson, make sure the Python stack can accommodate this feature.
