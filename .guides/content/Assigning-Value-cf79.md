## Assigning Value
The value stored in a variable can change. Use the assignment operator to give a variable a new value.

![Overwriting Values](.guides/images/variable-assignment.png)

The image above is **not** declaring two variables called `my_variable`. The first line declares the variable because this is the first instance. The second line overwrites `Hello world` with `Goodbye world`. Enter the code below and see the results of the `print` commands. Use the code visualizer to see how the value of `my_variable` changes.

```python
my_variable = "Hello world"
print(my_variable)
my_variable = "Goodbye world"
print(my_variable)
```
