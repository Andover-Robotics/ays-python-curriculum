## If Else Statement

|||challenge
## Your turn:
Create two integers `a` and `b` and assign them to values of your choice. If `a` is greater than `b`, then print `"a is greater than b"`. Otherwise, print `"a is less than b"`.

## What happens if you:
* Change the value of `a` and `b`?
* Change the operator in the conditional?

## Odd or Even

|||challenge
## Try this:
You can combine the if else statement with the modulo operator to determine if a number is odd or even:

* Modulo returns the remainder after division is performed
* Calculate the modulo (`%`) of any number and 2
* If the modulo is 0, then the number is even

## What happens if you:
* Change `num` to `3`?
* Change `num` to `0`?
* Change `num` to `-8`?
