## How to use Codio

The left panel contains a text editor. Use this to write and edit your code. The right panel contains instructions. A `TRY IT` or `Check It!` button will execute your code. A `Check It!` button compares your code with the expected output, and shows you the results.

## `print()`

`print()` is used to output text to the console, allowing you to communicate with your users. The message you want to output is placed *within* the parentheses, and is surrounded by `'` characters.

Some examples:
* `print('message')` will output `message` to the console
* `print('Learning Python is fun!')` will output `Learning Python is fun!` to the console
* `print(' ')` will output a blank space to the console

Note: Although there is no console visible through Codio, the output you are shown when you press a `TRY IT` button is what you have outputted to the console.

## Your First Challenge

Output `Hello World!` to the console. 

Make your changes to the code in the file editor on the left. Then, press the `TRY IT` button below to run the code and see the output.

*Note: pressing the button yields `Command was successfully executed.`, your code had no errors but nothing was outputted to the console*
