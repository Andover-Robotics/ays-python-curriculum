The following is a series of exercises using TurtleWorld. They are meant to be fun, but they have a point, too. While you are working on them, think about what the point is.

The following sections have solutions to the exercises, so donâ€™t look until you have finished (or at least tried).

1.  Write a function called <span>square</span> that takes a parameter named <span>t</span>, which is a turtle. It should use the turtle to draw a square.

    Write a function call that passes <span>bob</span> as an argument to <span>square</span>, and then run the program again.

2.  Add another parameter, named <span>length</span>, to <span>square</span>. Modify the body so length of the sides is <span>length</span>, and then modify the function call to provide a second argument. Run the program again. Test your program with a range of values for <span>length</span>.

3.  Make a copy of <span>square</span> and change the name to <span>polygon</span>. Add another parameter named <span>n</span> and modify the body so it draws an n-sided regular polygon. Hint: The exterior angles of an n-sided regular polygon are $360/n$ degrees.

4.  Write a function called <span>circle</span> that takes a turtle, <span>t</span>, and radius, <span>r</span>, as parameters and that draws an approximate circle by calling <span>polygon</span> with an appropriate length and number of sides. Test your function with a range of values of <span>r</span>.

    Hint: figure out the circumference of the circle and make sure that <span>length \* n = circumference</span>.

5.  Make a more general version of <span>circle</span> called <span>arc</span> that takes an additional parameter <span>angle</span>, which determines what fraction of a circle to draw. <span>angle</span> is in units of degrees, so when <span>angle=360</span>, <span>arc</span> should draw a complete circle.
