* ### Demonstrate how to increment or decrement a variable
* ### Identify the order of operations

## Assumptions
* Students are comfortable with declaring variables and using the `print` statement.
* The only real explanation of the operation itself will be for modulo. Students are assumed to be familiar with the rest of these operators.

## Limitations
* The usefulness of modulo is not demonstrated as conditionals have not yet been introduced.
* `sqrt(4)` is introduced as `4 ** 0.5` so that students don't have to worry about importing and using libraries.
