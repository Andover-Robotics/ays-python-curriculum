# Greatest Common Divisor

A number, $a$, is a power of $b$ if it is divisible by $b$ and $a/b$ is a power of $b$. Write a function called `is_power` that takes parameters <span>a</span> and <span>b</span> and returns <span>True</span> if <span>a</span> is a power of <span>b</span>. Note: you will have to think about the base case.

The greatest common divisor (GCD) of $a$ and $b$ is the largest number that divides both of them with no remainder.

One way to find the GCD of two numbers is based on the observation that if $r$ is the remainder when $a$ is divided by $b$, then $gcd(a,
b) = gcd(b, r)$. As a base case, we can use $gcd(a, 0) = a$.

Write a function called `gcd` that takes parameters <span>a</span> and <span>b</span> and returns their greatest common divisor.
