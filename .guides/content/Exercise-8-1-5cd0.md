---------

Read the documentation of the string methods at <http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods>. You might want to experiment with some of them to make sure you understand how they work. <span>`strip`</span> and <span>`replace`</span> are particularly useful.

The documentation uses a syntax that might be confusing. For example, in `find(sub[, start[, end]])`, the brackets indicate optional arguments. So <span>sub</span> is required, but <span>start</span> is optional, and if you include <span>start</span>, then <span>end</span> is optional.
