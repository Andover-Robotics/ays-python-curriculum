Two words “interlock” if taking alternating letters from each forms a new word. For example, “shoe” and “cold” interlock to form “schooled”. Solution: <http://thinkpython2.com/code/interlock.py>. Credit: This exercise is inspired by an example at <http://puzzlers.org>.

1.  Write a program that finds all pairs of words that interlock. Hint: don’t enumerate all pairs!

2.  Can you find any words that are three-way interlocked; that is, every third letter forms a word, starting from the first, second or third?
