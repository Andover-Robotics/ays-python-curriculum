## Compound Conditional Statements

|||challenge
## Your turn:
Write a conditional statement that checks if an integer `num` is even **and** greater than 10.

## What happens if you:
* Change `num` to `8`?
* Change `and` to `or`?
* Change `==` to `!=`?

## Why Use Compound Conditionals

Both code snippets below do the same thing: Ask if `my_var` is greater than 15 and if `my_var` is less than 20. If both of these are true, then Python will print the value of `my_var`.

The code with the compound conditional (on the right) has fewer lines of code, and is easier for a human to read. In fact, it almost reads like a sentence.
