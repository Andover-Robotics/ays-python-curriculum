---------------

The <span>+</span> operator concatenates lists:

    >>> a = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> b = [4, 5, 6]
    >>> c = a + b
    >>> c
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

The <span>*</span> operator repeats a list a given number of times:

    >>> [0] * 4
    [0, 0, 0, 0]
    >>> [1, 2, 3] * 3
    [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]

The first example repeats four times. The second example repeats the list three times.
