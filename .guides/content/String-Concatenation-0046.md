## Adding Strings
What if you had two separate strings, such as `'Hello '` and `'World!'` and you wanted to combine them? This process, known as **string concatenation**, is very simple to do in python. Simply place a `+` between the strings!

## Demo
Let's say we had the following code:
```python
print('Hello ' + 'World!')
```

What would expect the output to be?

Were you right?

## Try it Yourself
Use the file on the left to experiment with string concatenation. What happens if you reverse the order of the strings? What happens if there are more than 2 strings? Play around and use the button below to see the output.
