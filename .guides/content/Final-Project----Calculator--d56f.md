# Welcome to your final project!

Final Project - Calculator

Your goal is to make a calculator that can perform 4 basic math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division - based on the user’s input.

(We will demo the calculator for you so you can get a clearer idea of what it should look like.)


Here are the minimum requirements for the calculator:

- The calculator should add, subtract, multiply, or divide any 2 numbers. (decimals included -- remember the float data type?)
- The user should be able to enter which of the 4 operations they want to do: you should use a conditional statement to determine how to proceed based on their input (which could just be a number based on your instructions!)
- The user should be able to continue to calculate for as long as they want. (Hint: use a while loop!)

Bonus/Challenge Ideas:

- Use a for loop to let the user add or multiply as many #s as they want

- Input Validation - what happens if the user tries to add something that isn’t a number, or types something into your selection menu that isn’t understandable?
