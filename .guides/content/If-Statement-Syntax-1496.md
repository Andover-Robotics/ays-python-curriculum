## If Statement Syntax

![If Statement Syntax](.guides/images/if-statement-syntax.png)

Conditionals are pieces of code that make a decision about what the program is going to do next. The most common conditional is the if statement.

If statements in Python must contain the following items:
* the keyword `if`
* a boolean expression
* a colon
* 4 spaces of indentation for all lines of code that will run if the boolean expression is true.

```python
if 5 > 4:
    print("1st command if true")
    print("2nd command if true")
```
