----------------

<span>`zip`</span> is a built-in function that takes two or more sequences and returns a list of tuples where each tuple contains one element from each sequence. The name of the function refers to a zipper, which joins and interleaves two rows of teeth.

This example zips a string and a list:

    >>> s = 'abc'
    >>> t = [0, 1, 2]
    >>> zip(s, t)
    <zip object at 0x7f7d0a9e7c48>

The result is a <span>**zip object**</span> that knows how to iterate through the pairs. The most common use of <span>zip</span> is in a <span>for</span> loop:

    >>> for pair in zip(s, t):
    ...     print(pair)
    ...
    ('a', 0)
    ('b', 1)
    ('c', 2)

A zip object is a kind of <span>**iterator**</span>, which is any object that iterates through a sequence. Iterators are similar to lists in some ways, but unlike lists, you canâ€™t use an index to select an element from an iterator.

If you want to use list operators and methods, you can use a zip object to make a list:

    >>> list(zip(s, t))
    [('a', 0), ('b', 1), ('c', 2)]

The result is a list of tuples; in this example, each tuple contains a character from the string and the corresponding element from the list.

If the sequences are not the same length, the result has the length of the shorter one.

    >>> list(zip('Anne', 'Elk'))
    [('A', 'E'), ('n', 'l'), ('n', 'k')]

You can use tuple assignment in a <span>for</span> loop to traverse a list of tuples:

    t = [('a', 0), ('b', 1), ('c', 2)]
    for letter, number in t:
        print(number, letter)

Each time through the loop, Python selects the next tuple in the list and assigns the elements to <span>letter</span> and <span>number</span>. The output of this loop is:

    0 a
    1 b
    2 c

If you combine <span>zip</span>, <span>for</span> and tuple assignment, you get a useful idiom for traversing two (or more) sequences at the same time. For example, `has_match` takes two sequences, <span>t1</span> and <span>t2</span>, and returns <span>True</span> if there is an index <span>i</span> such that <span>t1[i] == t2[i]</span>:

    def has_match(t1, t2):
        for x, y in zip(t1, t2):
            if x == y:
                return True
        return False

If you need to traverse the elements of a sequence and their indices, you can use the built-in function <span>`enumerate`</span>:

    for index, element in enumerate('abc'):
        print(index, element)

The result from <span>enumerate</span> is an enumerate object, which iterates a sequence of pairs; each pair contains an index (starting from 0) and an element from the given sequence. In this example, the output is

    0 a
    1 b
    2 c

Again.
