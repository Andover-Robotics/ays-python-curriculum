Write a function called `mul_time` that takes a Time object and a number and returns a new Time object that contains the product of the original Time and the number.

Then use `mul_time` to write a function that takes a Time object that represents the finishing time in a race, and a number that represents the distance, and returns a Time object that represents the average pace (time per mile).
