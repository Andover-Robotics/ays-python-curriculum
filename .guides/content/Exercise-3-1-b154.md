---------

Write a function named `right_justify` that takes a string named <span>s</span> as a parameter and prints the string with enough leading spaces so that the last letter of the string is in column 70 of the display.


       >>> right_justify('monty')
                                                                     monty

Hint: Use string concatenation and repetition. Also, Python provides a built-in function called <span>len</span> that returns the length of a string, so the value of `len('monty')` is 5.
