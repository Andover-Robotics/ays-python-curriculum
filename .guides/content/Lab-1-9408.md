## Lab 1

A previous lesson stated that the `seek` method can be used to move Python back to the beginning of a text file so it can be read again. Another way to do this is to read the contents of the text file to a list. Python can iterate over a list as many times as it wants without having to use the `seek` method.

Start by importing the `os` module. Create a `path` variable. However, the the path for the text file is slightly different that what you have seen before. Instead, use `student_folder/.labs`. Create the variable `text` and assign it the value of an empty list.

```python
import os

path = "student_folder/.labs"
text = []
```

Open the text file `files-lab1.txt` in read mode. Read all of the text at once, and assign that to `text`.

```python
with open(os.path.join(path, "files-lab1.txt"), "r") as input_file:
    text = input_file.readlines()
```

The contents of the text file now reside in the variable `text`. To prove this, go to the next line and remove the indentation. This will close the text file. Next, print the first element of the variable `text`.

```python
print(text[0])
```

{try it}(python3 code/files/lab1.py 1)

You should see a passage from Bram Stoker's *Dracula*. You can access the paragraph again by referencing the variable `text`.

```python
print(text[0].upper())
```

{try it}(python3 code/files/lab1.py 2)

Storing the value of a text file in a list variable is another way to access text without having to close and then open the text file.
