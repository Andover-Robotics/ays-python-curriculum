## The Help Function

Python has a built-in function called `help` that explains how other standard functions work. This is a handy way of learning how to use a function without having to look it up in the official documentation. 

```python
help(len)
```

{try it}(python3 code/functions/docstring.py 1)

## Your Turn!
* Say you wanted to find out what the max function did. How could you figure this out?
* What if you wanted to call help on your own greet_twice function? Do you think it would be helpful? Try it!

{try it}(python3 code/functions/docstring.py 2)

Unfortunately, Python doesn't automatically come up with a way to call help on user-defined functions in a way that is actually helpful. At this stage, the best way to clarify the purpose of your own functions is good commenting!
