Much like the calculator procedure you saw on the last page, each line of code in Python represents one or more individual instructions, called **statements**. These statements operate on representations of logic and data, called **expressions**. In a program, the computer reads all the lines of code from top to bottom and run each line as soon as the computer understands it.

To the left of this guide, you will find a dark window with some text in it. The cursor is to the right of `In [1]: `, where you will enter _expressions_ and _statements_ for the computer to run. Try typing in `2 + 3` and pressing Enter.

The computer should respond with the result of its evaluating `2 + 3`, which should be `5`.

This conversational interface is called an **interpreter**, as it interprets your lines of input as Python code and tries to run them. As we get acquainted with the basic concepts of programming, the interpreter is your handy buddy, ready to interpret whatever you type into it in an instant. For now, you are free to try other calculations, even divisions by zero _(hint: you will not lose all your friends, as Siri may claim)_.

If you are presented with a code editor in a future section in this module, the interpreter resides under the "Terminal" tab on the left pane, which is accessible at the top of the pane.
