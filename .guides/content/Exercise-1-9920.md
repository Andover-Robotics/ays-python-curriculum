## Lists Exercise 1

**Problem**
Write a program that takes a list of integers called `numbers` and replaces each element greater than 10 with a `'*'` (**Note** use single quotes, the auto-grader will not work with double quotes). Print the new version of `numbers`.

**Expected Output**
* If `numbers = [30, 1, 20, 4]` then you will print `['*', 1, '*', 4]`
* If `numbers = [5, 9, 11, 23]` then you will print `[5, 9, '*', '*']`

<details><summary>**Hint**</summary>Using the iteration variable alone is not sufficient to change the element of a list. You need to be able to access the **index** of the iteration variable to modify the element.</details>

**Important**
Do not submit your code to be graded with the variable `numbers`. The auto-grader will declare the variable for you.
