Please complete the following challenges to solidify your understanding of numbers and mathematical operations.

## Challenge One: A Large Product
What is the product of 100, 200, 350, and 500?

{try it}(python3 code/fundamentals/numbers_diy.py)

<details><summary>Solution:</summary>You should get `3500000000`. To obtain this result, multiply all the numbers and print the result.</details>

## Challenge Two: Tip
If my meal cost $37.50 and I would like to pay an additional 18% as a tip, how much do I owe in total?

{try it}(python3 code/fundamentals/numbers_diy.py)

<details><summary>Solution:</summary>You should get `44.25`. There are a few ways to obtain the result, the simplest of which would be multiplying the cost by 1.18.</details>

## Challenge Three: Average Speed
A car travels 150 miles in 120 minutes. What is its average speed in miles per hour? Please do all calculations and conversions in your code.

{try it}(python3 code/fundamentals/numbers_diy.py)

<details><summary>Solution:</summary>You should get `75`. The purpose of this challenge is to demonstrate the importance of PEMDAS. `print(150 / 120 / 60)` gives an an incorrect answer, but `print(150 / (120 / 60))` gives the right answer. </details>
