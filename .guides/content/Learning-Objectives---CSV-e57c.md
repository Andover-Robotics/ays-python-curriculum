## Assumptions
Students have completed the units on loops and strings.

## Limitations
These problems will be working with CSV files. Students need to know how to open folders and files in the file directory. All of the files will be located in the `student_folder/csv`. Students will encounter some abstract ideas like unpacking variable names from a CSV file and a list of lists.
