--------------------------

An <span>**expression**</span> is a combination of values, variables, and operators. A value all by itself is considered an expression, and so is a variable, so the following are all legal expressions:

    >>> 42
    42
    >>> n
    17
    >>> n + 25
    42

When you type an expression at the prompt, the interpreter <span>**evaluates**</span> it, which means that it finds the value of the expression. In this example, <span>n</span> has the value 17 and <span>n + 25</span> has the value 42.

A <span>**statement**</span> is a unit of code that has an effect, like creating a variable or displaying a value.

    >>> n = 17
    >>> print(n)

The first line is an assignment statement that gives a value to <span>n</span>. The second line is a print statement that displays the value of <span>n</span>.

When you type a statement, the interpreter <span>**executes**</span> it, which means that it does whatever the statement says. In general, statements donâ€™t have values.
