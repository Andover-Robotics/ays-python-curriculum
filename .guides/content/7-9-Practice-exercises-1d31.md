Copy the loop from SectionÂ 7.5 and encapsulate it in a function called `mysqrt` that takes <span>a</span> as a parameter, chooses a reasonable value of <span>x</span>, and returns an estimate of the square root of <span>a</span>.

To test it, write a function named `test_square_root` that prints a table like this:

    a   mysqrt(a)     math.sqrt(a)  diff
    -   ---------     ------------  ----
    1.0 1.0           1.0           0.0
    2.0 1.41421356237 1.41421356237 2.22044604925e-16
    3.0 1.73205080757 1.73205080757 0.0
    4.0 2.0           2.0           0.0
    5.0 2.2360679775  2.2360679775  0.0
    6.0 2.44948974278 2.44948974278 0.0
    7.0 2.64575131106 2.64575131106 0.0
    8.0 2.82842712475 2.82842712475 4.4408920985e-16
    9.0 3.0           3.0           0.0

The first column is a number, $a$; the second column is the square root of $a$ computed with `mysqrt`; the third column is the square root computed by <span>math.sqrt</span>; the fourth column is the absolute value of the difference between the two estimates.

The built-in function <span>eval</span> takes a string and evaluates it using the Python interpreter. For example:

    >>> eval('1 + 2 * 3')
    7
    >>> import math
    >>> eval('math.sqrt(5)')
    2.2360679774997898
    >>> eval('type(math.pi)')
    <class 'float'>

Write a function called `eval_loop` that iteratively prompts the user, takes the resulting input and evaluates it using <span>eval</span>, and prints the result.

It should continue until the user enters `'done'`, and then return the value of the last expression it evaluated.
