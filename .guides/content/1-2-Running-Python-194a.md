--------------

On the left-hand side of the screen, you will see the following text:

```python
Your code goes here...
```

This is the code editor, and you will use throughout this course to write you programs. Enter the code below and click the button to run it.

```python
1 + 1
```

{Try it}(python3 code/1-2-playground.py)

Notice how nothing happened. Python did in fact add the numbers together, but it didn't "do anything" because no command was given to display the answer. Change your code so it looks like the code below and run it again.

```python
print(1 +1)
```

{Try it}(python3 code/1-2-playground.py 2)

The only difference between the two programs is the `print` command. Although it doesn’t actually print anything on paper, the `print` command displays a result on the screen.

Traditionally, the first program you write in a new language is called “Hello, World!” because all it does is display the words “Hello, World!” In Python, it looks like this:

```python
print('Hello, World!')
```

{Try it}(python3 code/1-2-playground.py 3)

Look closely at the code you wrote and its output. The quotation marks in the program mark the beginning and end of the text to be displayed; they don’t appear in the result.

```python
Hello, World!
```

The parentheses indicate that `print` is a function. We’ll get to functions in a later chapter.

Now you’re ready to get started. From here on, I assume that you know how to use the code editor and run code.
