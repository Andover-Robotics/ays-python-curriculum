## Odd or Even
Very often while programming, you will need to determine if a number is odd or even. We will now guide you through a common way of doing it.

|||challenge
## Try this:
Set `num` to some integer. Use the if and else statements with the modulo operator to determine if `num` is odd or even.

**Some Tips:**
* Modulo returns the remainder after division (`8 % 3 == 2` is True)
* Calculate the modulo (`%`) of any number and 2
* If the modulo is 0, then the number is even (`8 % 2 == 0` is True, so 8 is even)

## What happens if you:
* Change `num` to `3`?
* Change `num` to `0`?
* Change `num` to `-8`?

## Practice

## Problem 1
Create two integers `a` and `b` and assign them to values of your choice. If `a` is greater than `b`, then print `"a is greater than b"`. Otherwise, print `"a is less than b"`.

## Problem 2
Santa Claus needs your help! Write an if else statement that prints `"present"` if a kid is nice and `"coal"` if a kid is naughty (not nice).

<details><summary>Hint</summary>There are a few different ways to approach this. The simplest way is to create a boolean `nice` and set it to `True` or `False`. </details>
