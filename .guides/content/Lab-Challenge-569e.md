## Changing a List
Write a program that takes a list of integers called `numbers` and will print a list with the elements `odd` or `even` based on the elements of `numbers`. For example, if `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, then your program will print `[odd, even, odd, even]`.

**Important**, the variable `numbers` is already declared as an empty list. Add some values to it and test your code. However, **do not** submit your code to be graded with the variable declaration. The auto-grader will declare the variable for you.
