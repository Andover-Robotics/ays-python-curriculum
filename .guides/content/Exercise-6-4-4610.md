A number, $a$, is a power of $b$ if it is divisible by $b$ and $a/b$ is a power of $b$. Write a function called `is_power` that takes parameters <span>a</span> and <span>b</span> and returns <span>True</span> if <span>a</span> is a power of <span>b</span>. Note: you will have to think about the base case.
