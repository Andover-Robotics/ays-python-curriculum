## Lists Exercise 2

**Problem**
Write a program that takes a list called `my_list` (it could be a list of any data type) and prints the list three times if the length of the list is less than 5. If the length of `my_list` is greater than or equal to 5, then print the list one time. **Note** use single quotes if you have a list of strings, the auto-grader will not work with double quotes.

**Expected Output**
* If `my_list = ['hi', 'hello']` then you will print `['hi', 'hello', 'hi', 'hello', 'hi', 'hello']`
* If `my_list = [65, 111, 2, 81, 65, 32]` then you will print `[65, 111, 2, 81, 65, 32]`

**Important**
Do not submit your code to be graded with the variable `my_list`. The auto-grader will declare the variable for you.
