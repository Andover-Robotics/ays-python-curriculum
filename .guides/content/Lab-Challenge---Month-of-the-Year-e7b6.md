## Conditionals Challenge 

Write a program that determines the month of the year based on the value of a variable called `month`. The variable will be a number from 1 to 12 (`1` is January, `2` is February, etc.). Use a `print` statement to write the month to the screen.

**Important**, you will need to declare the variable `month` as you write and test your code. However, **do not** submit your code to be graded with the variable declaration. The auto-grader will declare the variable for you.
