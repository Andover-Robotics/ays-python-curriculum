## The Addition (+) Operator
The addition operator works as you would expect with numbers.

```python
print(7 + 3)
```

{try it}(python3 code/operators/playground-addition.py 1)

You can also add two variables together.

```python
a = 7
b = 3
c = a + b
print(c)
```

{try it}(python3 code/operators/playground-addition.py 2)

## What happens if you:
* Make `a` of type float (e.g. `a = 7.0`)?
* Make `b` a negative number (e.g. `b = -3`)?
* Make `b` an explicitly positive number (e.g. `b = +3`)
