===============

The language feature most often associated with object-oriented programming is <span>**inheritance**</span>. Inheritance is the ability to define a new class that is a modified version of an existing class. In this chapter I demonstrate inheritance using classes that represent playing cards, decks of cards, and poker hands.

If you don’t play poker, you can read about it at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker>, but you don’t have to; I’ll tell you what you need to know for the exercises.

Code examples from this chapter are available from <http://thinkpython2.com/code/Card.py>.
