## Command Line Interface

The next step is to build an interface for the user of this program. The interface should run continuously until the user tells the program to quite. Define a function `user_interface` with no parameters. Inside the function, have a `while True` loop. The body of the loop should be `pass`.

```python
def user_interface():
    while True:
        pass
```

The interface should ask the user two questions: what is category by which the data should be sorted and should the program sort in ascending or descending order.
