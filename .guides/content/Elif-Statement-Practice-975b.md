## Problem 1

You are playing a game of sportsball. Participants will be given an award based on how many points they scored:

* 100+ points: Gold medal
* 60-99 points: Silver medal
* 30-59 points: Bronze medal
* Less than 30 points: Participation award

Write an if elif else statement to determine which award you will get.

## Problem 2

You decide to write a program that decides what kind of outfit you should wear depending on the temperature. For example:

* 60+: T-shirt and shorts
* 50-59: T-shirt, shorts, and light jacket
* 30-49: Sweatshirt and jeans
* Less than 30: Winter coat and sweatpants

You are free to change the temperatures and clothes based on your own preferences. However, please make sure that you have at least four different outfits.

## Problem 3

Edit your code from **Problem 2** so that it also takes into account the type of weather (sunny, rainy, etc). You may need to add more clothing elements (raincoat, snow boots, etc).
