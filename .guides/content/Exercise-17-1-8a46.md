---------

Using Time2.py, change the attributes of <span>Time</span> to be a single integer representing seconds since midnight. Then modify the methods (and the function `int_to_time`) to work with the new implementation. You should not have to modify the test code in <span>main</span>. When you are done, the output should be the same as before.
