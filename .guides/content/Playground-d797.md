This is a place for you to try out code on your own. Whenever you press _Enter_, the terminal program will try to evaluate your input and print its value immediately. This program is commonly called an **interpreter**.

For example, you can use the interpreter as a calculator. Try entering `1 + 4` or `9 / 20`.

You can enter conditional expressions as well. Try entering `3 == 3` and `5 > 6`.

You can define variables and access them in subsequent inputs. Try declaring a list and modifying it.

Have fun!
