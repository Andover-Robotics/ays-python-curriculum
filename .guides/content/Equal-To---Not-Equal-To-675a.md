----------

Boolean operators are operators that return a boolean value (true or false).

## Equal To

Python uses the `==` operator to determine equality. Beginners often confuse the `=` and the `==` operators. Remember, `=` is the assignment operator.

```python
a = 5
b = 5
print(a == b)
```

{try it}(python3 code/operators/playground-equality.py 1)

## What happens if you:
* Change `b` to `1`?
* Change `a` to `True` and `b` to `1`?
* Change `a` to `True` and `b` to `False`?

## Not Equal To

The `!=` operator checks to see if two values are not equal.

```python
a = 5
b = 5
print(a != b)
```
