----------
Loops are one of the most commonly used concepts in programming. Anytime a task needs to be repeated, a loop should be used. Iteration is another word used to refer to repetition in programming. Two types of loops will be introduced in this module. A **for loop** runs a predetermined number of times, and the **while loop** runs as long as a condition is true. We will also talk about **nested loops**, which is a loop inside of another loop.
