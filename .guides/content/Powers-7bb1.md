## Powers

Python uses the `**` operator for powers (or exponents). So `2 ** 2` would be two to the second power.

```python
a = 2 ** 2
print(a)
```

## What happens if you:
* Change `a` to `2 ** 0`?
* Change `a` to `2 ** -2`?
* Change `a` to `2 ** False`?

## Square Root

The square root of 4 can be calculated as 4 raised to the power of $\frac{1}{2}$. In Python, this is written as `4 ** 0.5`.

<details><summary><b>The </b><code>sqrt</code><b> function</b></summary>Python does have a <code>sqrt</code> function, but it requires you to import the `math` library. Libraries will be covered in a later lesson.<img src=".guides/images/sqrt.png" /></details>

```python
square_root = 4 ** 0.5
print(square_root)
```
